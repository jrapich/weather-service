<img src='./assets/images/license.svg'>

## Description
Weather Service is a simple application that uses the Open Weather API to do a simple search for current and future weather conditions  of a city.  

It uses javascript and jQuery to interact with the Open Weather API, and append/remove results on the page. It will show the current weather conditions of a city the user will search for, as well as a basic weather forecast for the next 5 days.
